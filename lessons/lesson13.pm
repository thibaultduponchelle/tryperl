__DATA__
<h1>Chomp over there</h1>

<h2>Conclusion about chomp</h2>

We will close these samples around chomp by checking the final content of our <strong>$tor</strong> variable.<br/><br/>
Please check that trailing carriage return was removed with <code>print "($tor)"</code>.

<h2>Chop</h2>
There's a <i>bazooka</i> version of <strong>chomp</strong> that is called <strong>chop</strong>.<br/><br/>
<strong>chop</strong> does not care about the character but chop in any case !<br/>
For instance, if you start <code>chop $tor</code> it will crop the last <strong>"n"</strong> from "onion" in the variable <strong>$tor</strong> !<br/>
(Note that it would have worked with a space)
